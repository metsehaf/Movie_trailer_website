# Movie Trailer website
Movie trailer webste is a server side website created by utilizing python and HTML for showing six of my alltime favourite movies. It is part of Udacity's online course: **Full stack developer**. The website has the title, images and a Youtube trailer for the movies. Enjoy!
# Documentation
Please refer to the documentation for the python files [@media.py](Movie_trailer_website/media.py), [@entertainment_center.py](Movie_trailer_website/entertainment_center.py). The file [fresh_tomatoes.py](Movie_trailer_website/fresh_tomatoes.py) contains the `open_movies_page()` function that will take in your list of movies and generate an HTML file including this content, producing a website to showcase your favorite movies.
# Installation
After forking and cloning all the files in to the same folder, launch [fresh_tomatoes.html](Movie_trailer_website/fresh_tomatoes.html) to open it in your browser. The html includes a bootstrap css and Javascripts framework Jquey to make our website neat.

The team at Udacity made the initial Html code and I added and modified the Python files.
